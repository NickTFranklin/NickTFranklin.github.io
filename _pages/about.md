Hello! I am a scientist working in machine learning and cognitive science. 

My research focus is on machine learning and computational models of intelligence, and I am deeply interested in how both people and machines learn. My current reaserch includes reinforcement learning and deep generative models.

Most recently, I was at a startup (Hyperscience) doing deep learning research in computer vision and natural language processing.  Before that, I was a Postdoc in [Sam Gershman's lab at Harvard](https://gershmanlab.com). I did my PhD work with [Michael Frank at Brown University](https://www.lnccbrown.com).  

I'm based in Brooklyn and I enjoy surfing, reading and hanging out with my family. In that picture of me playing chess, I am loosing badly.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
